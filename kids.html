      <h2>Youth Martial Arts?</h2>
      <p>Many parents place their kids in martial arts with the hopes that it will teach them respect and discipline, others out of concern that their child is being bullied - or even that their child is the bully, and still others because they have fond memories of their own martial arts classes as children. Whatever your reason for looking into Brazilian jiu jitsu for your child, know that we understand that choosing where to go can be an intimidating task.</p>

      <p>We believe that our school is the best in Portland. Here at RGAPDX, we know that it is important to train and learn to use your body in a way that not only promotes growth but is also sustainable - which is to say that safety is of utmost importance to us. We take great pride in teaching things like learning to fall without injury and to treat your training partner with respect, how to use leverage to escape from an opponent and defend yourself without punching and kicking, all while having an awesome time.</p>

      <p>
        Our team is always looking for new training partners and we have some of the fiercest girls and boys around.

      <h3>KIDS BRAZILIAN JIU-JITSU</h3>
      <p>The Renzo Gracie Kids Program is designed to provide a safe environment for children to learn how to defend themselves while having fun. The program itself helps to develop confidence, self-respect, and responsibility. Our program achieves this by focusing on the concepts of mutual welfare and respect.</p>

      <p>In addition to self-defense techniques, the Kids program also focuses heavily on skill building drills to develop body awareness, strength, agility, and flexibility. All techniques are taught with a safety first mentality which allows students to develop the confidence to apply the techniques on resisting partners without sacrificing effectiveness.</p>

      <h4>Our kids classes are offered for three different age ranges:</h4>

      <p>Three and four year old’s meet once a week, Saturday morning for a  ”tumbling” or “dynamic movements” class. Through games and exploration, students will learn forward and backward rolls, falls, back bends and the basics of more dynamic movements such as cartwheels and handstands. The aim is to both prepare their bodies for jiu jitsu/wrestling and to get the younger kids a little more experience listening, paying attention, and following directions while being in a class with others. Lots of games, lots of fun.</p>

      <p>Registration for this class is limited to 10 per class. We ask that you please register online prior to class here.</p>

      <p>Older kids classes are divided (5-7) and (8+); they have possible classes four times a week.</p>

      <p>Full class schedule is viewable online <a href="schedule.html">here</a>. If you have any questions about enrollment or registration, please email us at <a href="mailto:info@renzogracieportland.com">info@renzogracieportland.com</a>.</p>

      <h3>GETTING STARTED</h3>

      <p>To get started, please send us an email with a brief introduction.  The first step is to set up a private or small group 30 minute introductory lesson with your child and our kids coach Justin.  This lesson serves as a first meeting to answer any remaining questions you have about the program, to orient parents and kids to the facility and class structure, and to generally just make it easier for your kid to jump into their first group class. After this lesson, you are welcome to a free trial class.</p>

                  <p class='quote'>"My son Bobby began training under Sensei Aaron at the age of 3. He learned real self-defense and ground techniques as opposed to mechanical moves, as well as respect for others.
He learned to leverage his own body size against his opponent’s to gain the upper hand. This is especially beneficial to children because it teaches them to overcome opponents who are both larger and stronger. A few years later he also learned striking and sparring techniques from Aaron. His teaching methods are such that the children just have fun and don’t feel like they are just doing boring drills. Bobby also studied under Jin Yung who is methodical and connects with each child in the class to bring out their individual strengths. At the end of each session children are paired off and allowed the opportunity to apply what they have learned in a “live” situation where the moves are not orchestrated by the instructor, but the student applies what they have learned and over time attain the proper instincts on how to react to different situations. This proves to be an effective and crucial part of Bobby’s training. Though the class was never instructed on tournament “rules” and “how to score points”, Bobby has placed and won medals in all the tournaments he’s participated in and today still grapples successfully against older and larger opponents.
If you are a parent looking for a safe environment where your child can obtain physical improvement, increased confidence and poise while instilling a solid sense of discipline that can provide benefits beyond fitness and defense, this is the place. Both Sensei Aaron and Jin are terrific motivators who know how to help children with different personalities attain their personal best. They develop leaders. More advanced older students are equally adept in encouraging and helping the younger students to fine tune their moves and skills while assisting in class.
All sessions are carefully monitored to ensure every child’s safety. Trainers provide plenty of hands-on instruction and encouragement while making the learning process fun. By developing mental strength over one’s own body, your child will naturally become more disciplined in other important areas as well, such as school and athletics."</p>

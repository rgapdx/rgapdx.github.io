      <h2>WHAT IS MUAY THAI?</h2>
      <p>Muay Thai, the national sport of Thailand, is a modern fighting sport evolved from traditional Thai martial arts that involves striking an opponent using one’s fists, elbows, knees, and shins, as well as manipulating an opponent’s body at a close distance to bring him or her to the ground. Unlike the majority of the world’s striking-specific fighting sports, which limit a practitioner’s ability to implement the majority of his or her limbs as striking weapons, such as boxing, which limits a practitioner to the use of punches, and Dutch kickboxing, which limits a practitioner to the use of punches, kicks, and single (non-clinching) knees, Muay Thai encourages the use of all the available physical tools of a practitioner to deliver strikes to an opponent. Also unlike nearly all other striking specific fighting sports, a significant portion of Muay Thai techniques are concerned with controlling, striking, and bringing opponents to the ground from positions in which the two combatants’ limbs are entangled at a close range in clinches, holds, or when one combatant has caught a strike thrown by his or her opponent. In Thailand, Muay Thai events are typically held in stadiums, arenas, event centers, or at local outdoor festivals, and involve two opponents fighting in a square ring, typically with boxing gloves but occasionally with traditional rope handwraps (Kard Chuek rules), for a duration of five three-minute rounds.</p>

      <h3>RENZO GRACIE PORTLAND’S FUNDAMENTALS OF THAI BOXING PROGRAM</h3>
      <p>
        The Fundamentals of Thai Boxing Program at Renzo Gracie Portland seeks to make students competent in the fundamental techniques of Muay Thai through a progressive process of introduction, controlled practice, and eventually, execution of the techniques at the maximum intensity possible. The program also seeks to provide students with a physically challenging environment in which they have an excellent opportunity to improve or maintain their physical fitness. Students are taught how to execute the critical stances, movements, punches, kicks, knees, elbows, checks, catches, lateral slips, parries, clinches, takedowns, and dumps of Muay Thai, as well as essential Muay Thai training practices, such as how to wrap his or her hands, how to hit a heavy bag, how to neck wrestle with a partner in a practice setting, and how to strike and hold Thai pads. Eventually, students are introduced to more advanced concepts, such as technique set-ups, the stacking and combining of techniques, and technical fighting strategies. Classes consist of a simple warm-up, the introduction of techniques followed by drilling of said techniques among partners or on heavy bags in a controlled atmosphere, followed by higher intensity Muay-Thai-specific drills and exercises to end the class. Once the student has demonstrated an appropriate level of competence in said techniques and has been familiarized in facilitative aspects of training, such as how to hold Thai pads for a partner, more of his or her class time will be devoted to practicing techniques in a live, maximum-intensity situation, either by striking Thai pads held by a partner, or by participating in neck-wrestling rounds, where the student will implement clinching techniques against a live, resisting opponent.
